# BluePrism-SqlBulkData
Blue prism project that reads bulk data from an Excel sheet into a SQL table using OLEDB.
This repository also includes a folder called "Troubleshooting" This folder contains a project that uses OLEDB to read data from an excel file into a collection in Blue Prism. This project was created after my project was unsuccessful in reading bulk data from excel to an SQL database in Blue Prism. Troubleshooting was meant to test the connection between Excel, OLE DB, and Blue Prism. This process is complete and has successfully inserted 110,066 records from Excel to SQL using OLEDB and Blue Prism.
